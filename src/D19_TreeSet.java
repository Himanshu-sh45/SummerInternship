// A TreeSet in java is a navigable set implementation based on tree map it provides
// an efficient way to store unique in a sorted order.
// A TreeMap is a self-balancing BST which means that the height of a tree remains relatable
// small even after so many insertion or deletion.
// When you add a value to a TreeSet it is store in a treemap with dummy value.
//
//Linked HashSet - it is a class in java that implements the set interface and extends the
// hashset class
// it is similar to the hashset, but it maintains also a double linked list running through all of
// its entries. it has unique elements
// link hashset maintains the insertion order of elements which means that the element were added
// to the set is preserved.
